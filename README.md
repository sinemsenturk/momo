# Momo Movie Logging App UI Design
Momo is a look-alike version of Letterboxd.


Welcome to the "Momo" UI design project repository. "Momo" is a concept for a movie logging app, inspired by the popular app Letterboxd. This project represents a significant milestone in my journey to create a professional portfolio.


Project Description

Momo is a movie logging app designed to cater to the needs of cinephiles and movie enthusiasts. Much like Letterboxd, the app allows users to log and review their favorite films, discover new movies, and interact with a community of fellow movie lovers. What makes "Momo" unique is the personal touch I've added to it by incorporating my favorite movies and TV characters as users, creating a special and personalized experience for users.


Technologies and Tools Used

The project was brought to life using Figma, a powerful design and prototyping tool. Figma allowed me to create a stunning and user-friendly interface, design interactive screens, and craft a unique user experience.
